This repository accompanies my Project IV report, Bayesian Inference for Stochastic Volatility Models, and contains all of the relevant R code used throughout the report, broken down into 12 separate R files. Also included is the dataset used in real_data_1, which is required for the code to run and is provided as an excel file. I invite you to follow the code along with the report, and run to produce your own results. The files are:
- black_scholes_model_1 (Chapter 3)
- heston_model_1 (Chapter 4, Section 4.2)
- heston_model_2 (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.1)
- heston_model_3 (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2)
- heston_model_4 (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2)
- heston_model_5 (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3)
- heston_model_6 (Chapter 4, Section 4.4.1)
- heston_model_7 (Chapter 4, Section 4.4.2)
- heston_model_8 (Chapter 4, Section 4.4.2)
- heston_model_9 (Chapter 4, Section 4.4.3)
- monte_carlo_op (Chapter 5)
- real_data_1 (Chapter 6)
